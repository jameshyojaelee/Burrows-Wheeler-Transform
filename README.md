## Burrows-Wheeler Transform

Suffix Arrays allow us to preprocess a long database string to perform pretty fast searches of short strings, but what if we want our searches to be even *faster*? We can preprocess our database string by constructing the Burrows-Wheeler Transform, which will enable even faster searches of short query sequences.
